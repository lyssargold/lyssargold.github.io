        <h3>Gen Y Meets Unentitled Reality</h3>
        <strong>Oct. 1, 2013</strong>
        <p>
        Happiness is the most sought-after emotion, but it's also the most elusive. However, there's actually a simple formula for the pursuit of happiness. It equals reality minus expectations, according to the blog "Wait But Why."
        </p><p>
        This logic is presented in the article "Why Generation Y Yuppies are Unhappy," which went viral after being shared on The Huffington Post last week. If our reality exceeds our expectations, we are set for life. But this has not been the case for members of Generation Y, who think they are special and thus set their expectations too high.
        </p><p>
        The notion makes sense on the surface, but the author's overgeneralizations and pervasive cynicism must be discounted. In any generation, there will be certain people with a sense of entitlement and others without.
        </p><p>
        It's true that students who haven't pursued internships and research opportunities in college, or made any other efforts to prepare for a career, will be in for a rude awakening. Given the current state of the economy, even the best-trained graduates will have to work hard to reach their goals.
        </p><p>
        Ask a handful of Gen Y-ers about the first job they expect to hold out of college (we did), and you'll hear the same response: "Do you mean the job I hope to have, or my realistic answer?" <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/the-miami-hurricane/gen-y-meets-unentitled-re_b_4012522.html">Read more.</a>

        <h3>Connectivity Is a Crucial Right</h3>
        <strong>Sept. 12, 2013</strong>
        <p>
        Every person on University of Miami's campus has access to WirelessCanes. We can surf the Internet using laptops and connect to Wi-Fi on our smartphones. We also have hundreds of computers at our disposal.
        </p><p>
        UM students don't need to worry about the cost of Internet, how much data they can use or how to go about gathering information. But five billion people on this planet can't say the same.
        </p><p>
        Two weeks ago, Facebook asked the question heard around the world: Is connectivity a human right? Founder Mark Zuckerberg thinks it is, and that's why his company has set out on a long-term mission to connect everyone on the planet via the Internet.
        </p><p>
        Adopted by the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states, "Everyone has the right to ... seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media ..."
        </p><p>
        Most people in the United States use the Internet everyday -- perhaps every hour -- to seek out information and communicate with others. It's considered an extension of free expression. Take that away from Americans and there would be an uproar. But they also have their basic needs met. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/the-miami-hurricane/connectivity-is-a-crucial_b_3897454.html">Read more.</a>

        <h3>Eating House's Christian Ochoa Will Play Villain on Burn Notice Tonight</h3>
        <strong>Aug. 15, 2013</strong>
        <p>
        Christian Ochoa has been with Eating House since the beginning, waiting on guests at the Coral Gables restaurant. But when customers tell him they recognize his face, that's not the reason.
        </p><p>
        "I also do a lot of modeling. There's stuff in some magazines and stuff that I've done for clothing and whatnot," says Ochoa. "So now it's getting to the point in my career where I have a face that people are saying, 'Hey I recognize you.'"
        </p><p>
        What's more, Ochoa has appeared in some independent films and played a lot of small parts in the recently canceled Miami-based drama Magic City. He was even an extra in Burn Notice once before. But tonight he will appear on Burn Notice for the first time with a speaking role, right alongside lead actor Jeffrey Donovan.
        </p><p>
        Ochoa started serving in Miami as part of a plan to act. It began with a phone call to chef Giorgio Rapicavoli -- who was his big brother in a Florida International University fraternity -- when the restaurant had just opened as a pop-up.
        </p><p>
        "I moved back here to try to get into acting. It was always my dream. When I moved back down, he was just starting Eating House," Ochoa recalls. "I remembered he was a chef, and a service job would give me the freedom throughout the day to go to castings."
        </p><p>
        Fast forward a year and a half, and he's becoming a familiar face. At a recent brunch, for example, Ochoa said he had three tables back-to-back that said they felt like they knew him but weren't sure where from. <a href="http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/shortorder/2013/08/eating_houses_christian_ochoa.php">Read more.</a>

        <h3>Saffron Supper Club's Night in Jerusalem: Didactic Dining</h3>
        <strong>Aug. 13, 2013</strong>
        <p>
        There's a verse in the Babylonian Talmud that goes something like this: When friends take leave of each other, it's best that they teach each other something, so that when they see each other next time, they remember what they've learned, and when they remember what they've learned, they will think of each other. Take a moment to let that run-on sentence sink in.
        </p><p>
        That's how we felt Sunday night after the third installment of the Saffron Supper Club. Our hosts, UrbanDaddy Miami editor Sara Liss and South Florida Foodies' Maude Eaton, welcomed guests into Chef Michael Jacob's Hidden Kitchen for their version of the Middle East in Miami through a Night in Jerusalem, an evening full of new culinary experiences and cultural lessons. We were taking our leave knowing we'd gained something to remember. Keep reading about the night we won't  forget.
        </p><p>
        Previously, their dinners have been held at the Miami Beach Botanical Gardens and Josh's Deli in Surfside, both with a Persian theme. Eaton, who was married to a Persian man and whose children are half-Persian, said she feels "a strong affinity toward the culture and cuisine."
        </p><p>
        Liss, on the other hand, has a special connection with the city of Jerusalem. She told her guests about how she'd studied there before starting university, and even found her husband and got married there. Chef Jacobs, who is now private chef to the Miami Heat, also worked at the King David Jerusalem Hotel, a luxury five-star hotel where world leaders like President Obama stay when they visit Israel. The stage was set for a night of authentic cuisine in the company of people who genuinely know and care about Middle Eastern culture. <a href="http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/shortorder/2013/08/saffron_supper_clubs_night_in.php"> Read more.</a>

        <h3>Blocks Pizza Deli in South Beach Blends Italy With Local Ingredients</h3>
        <strong>July 22, 2013</strong>
        <p>
        Inside Blocks Pizza Deli, managing partner Richard Collins chatters in Italian with Eugenio Vittoni, a fair-haired, slim European gentleman imported straight from Verona. And though the restaurant's concept is as Italian as most of the employees -- selling pizza by the slice and offering a take-and-bake option -- none of the ingredients comes from the mother country. Instead, the pizzeria has opted to use only the freshest local products.
        </p><p>
        While pizza chef Vittoni tends to the dough in the kitchen, Collins says there isn't even a freezer back there. "A lot of other pizzerias use frozen products. Ours are all-natural. We're using only fresh products," says Collins, the only American partner. "We freeze nothing here. We don't use preservatives, so if it's not consumed within 24 hours, it gets thrown out."
        </p><p>
        Asked about sourcing, Collins says, "Eugenio will go to the farmers' market and buy ingredients. He can tell you all about that. He'd come talk to you now, but if he leaves the batch of dough now, we'll have to throw it all away."
        </p><p>
        As great as it is that the sliced portobello mushrooms, organic leeks, and baby spinach leaves aren't defrosted toppings, the clear focus of the pizzeria is the use of "mother dough" -- the pride and joy of not only Blocks Pizza Deli's owners but also an entire "confraternity" of Italians going back centuries.
        </p><p>
        This is certainly no Domino's but also not Gino's or Miami's Best. Since the pizzeria opened two months ago, new customers have drawn comparisons to local favorite Pizza Rustica -- probably because pizza slices (called blocks) are sold by the rectangle, with specialty slices preassembled and ready to be baked in the oven.
        </p><p>
        But the difference is twofold. First, the slices are baked, not reheated, to order. It might be confusing, or even off-putting, to see unbaked pizza on display, but this only means the pizza with its freshly melted cheese tastes that much better. Second, of course, is the dough. All it takes is one bite to reveal that this light sourdough won't leave you feeling heavy the way a competitor's denser crust would. <a href="http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/shortorder/2013/07/blocks_pizza_deli_in_south_bea.php">Read more.</a>

      <h3>Mindfulness Miami minds mental health</h3>
      <strong>Jan. 27, 2014</strong>
      <p>
      Junior Jose Miguel Rosillo sits in a relaxed yet alert position on the second floor of the Student Activities Center. His window seat has a view of Lake Osceola, and the sun is setting. But his eyes are closed.
      </p><p>
      He inhales. Then exhales. For one minute, he focuses on his breath. This short exercise aimed at clearing up his mind is an example of mindfulness  training (MT) in its simplest form.
      </p><p>
      Mindfulness consists of a purposeful, non-judgmental awareness of the present moment.
      </p><p>
      “What you’re doing with mindfulness is training two faculties: attention and meta-attention,” Rosillo said. “There’s both instant gratification and long-term gratification.”
      </p><p>
      As Rosillo describes it, mindfulness helps you recognize the many layers of your current reality, and it increases the resolution and vividness with which you perceive things.
      </p><p>
      “Some people think you just sit around, that it’s passive,” he said. “That’s a misconception.”
      </p><p>
      In his quest to bring the message of mindfulness to the school, Rosillo has done much more than sitting around. There’s been some lying around, too.
      </p><p>
      Rosillo introduced junior Augustine Kazickas to the principles of mindfulness by recommending that his friend read “Search Inside Yourself” by Chade-Meng Tan, the book that started it all for Rosillo.
      </p><p>
      Kazickas read it over the summer, and they returned  to campus in the fall feeling the need to share mindfulness with the University of Miami community. One day in September, they were lying in the grass near the Knight Physics building, talking the idea over. <a href="http://www.themiamihurricane.com/2014/01/27/mindfulness-miami-minds-mental-health/">Read more.</a>

      <h3>Drugstore shuts down local strip-mall</h3>
      <strong>Sept. 23, 2013</strong>
      <p>
      On an inconspicuous corner of a strip-mall about a mile from the University of Miami’s Coral Gables campus, Beehive Natural Foods sells supplements and snacks. At lunchtime, the Beehive Juice Bar in the back bustles with hungry regulars at its counter.
      </p><p>
      “Carlitos, I’m starving,” murmurs a woman whose young daughter is attached to her hip.
      </p><p>
      “Right away,” the chef answers devotedly.
      </p><p>
      The customers are craving  vegetarian and vegan fare like bean sprout burgers. Still, more than that, they crave Beehive’s sense of community.
      </p><p>
      Beehive has been an institution for decades. The storefront’s current owner, Bob Penna, has been with Beehive for 33 years. Carlos Schicchi has been running the juice bar for 23 years.
      </p><p>
      “People go to the Beehive largely because of my dad’s personality,” said Gabriel Schicchi, son of the Brazilian chef. “He’s there waiting for you, serves the food that he made himself, talks to you, makes a ton of bad jokes, but makes you want to come back.”
      </p><p>
      Both Penna and Schicchi are the reason that loyal patrons from the South Miami area, including many from UM, return to the health food establishment again and again.
      </p><p>
      But a man-made disturbance may disrupt this natural order at Beehive.
      </p><p>
      CVS Pharmacy has bought out the strip-mall on the 5700 block of Bird Road. Beehive Natural Foods and Juice Bar will be kicked out this coming January. <a href="http://www.themiamihurricane.com/2013/09/23/drugstore-shuts-down-local-strip-mall/">Read more.</a>

        <h3>Mat Kearney takes Lauderdale Live audience on successful first date</h3>
        <strong>Dec. 9, 2013</strong>
        <p>
        Holding a music festival during South Florida’s busiest cultural weekend doesn’t sound like the brightest idea. But for those who attended Lauderdale Live instead of Art Basel from Friday through Sunday, it was a rare opportunity to have an intimate experience with the musicians (by default of having such a small crowd in attendance).
        </p><p>
        Mat Kearney, the “Ships in the Night” singer who got his start in 2006 with the album “Nothing Left to Lose,” performed in Downtown Fort Lauderdale’s Huizenga Plaza Saturday night, and took advantage of this atmosphere.
        </p><p>
        During his set, Kearney adopted an anything-goes approach, which made for a memorable experience.
        </p><p>
        “Tonight was unique,” he told The Miami Hurricane.
        </p><p>
        Kearney broke typical concert rules when he asked the crowd to shout out their requests and performed a song that his band didn’t even know how to back: “City of Black &amp; White,” the title track off his third album that he rarely plays for an audience.
        </p><p>
        “With a music festival like this, it’s not like a small venue where everyone comes for you. It’s kind of like a first date,” Kearney said. “The challenge is to win them over. You’re hoping to at least get a kiss at the end of the night.” <a href="http://www.themiamihurricane.com/2013/12/09/mat-kearney-takes-lauderdale-live-audience-on-successful-first-date/">Read more.</a>

        <h3>Dining halls implement green option</h3>
        <strong>Feb. 7, 2013</strong>
        <p>
        Freshmen leaving Hecht-Stanford Dining Hall with disposable to-go containers enjoy eating their meals outdoors, making conversation with friends outside of Stanford Residential College, and looking out at the intramural fields. These students finish eating and stack their boxes artfully, like professional Jenga players.
        </p><p>
        But the boxes piled atop the trash bins eventually form a replica of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. When a dozen to-go containers become a dozen plus one, the spillover transforms into litter all over the ground.
        </p><p>
        Trash bins overflowing with disposable take-out boxes, which are compostable, can be seen outside of the Mahoney-Pearson and Hecht-Stanford dining halls on a daily basis. When compostable items became litter, freshman Athena Jones knew there was a problem.
        </p><p>
        Jones, the education outreach co-chair for the Energy &amp; Conservation Organization (ECO) Agency, is now working with the members of Student Government’s green programming board to rectify this waste issue by promoting use of reusable rather than disposable boxes.
        </p><p>
        “They’re biodegradable if you do compost properly, but otherwise they’re going to a traditional landfill when they’re placed in these garbage cans …” Jones said. “They actually have the same life in the landfill that a Styrofoam box would have, and they produce more carbon dioxide to make. It’s a much more intensive process to make these boxes and therefore they have more of a carbon footprint on the environment than Styrofoam.” <a href="http://www.themiamihurricane.com/2013/02/07/dining-halls-implement-green-option/">Read more.</a>

        <h3>Election Day at UM brings surprises, student enthusiasm</h3>
        <strong>Nov. 6, 2012</strong>
        <p>
        Students at UM hit the polls on campus as early as 7 a.m., as soon as they opened.
        </p><p>
        Both presidential candidates, including President Barack Obama and Republican candidate Mitt Romney, have been looking to garner support from the state of Florida, which has a total of 29 electoral votes and has been considered a powerful swing state during this election.
        </p><p>
        ...
        </p><p>
        <strong>Undecided at the poll</strong>
        <br/>
        Fifth-year senior Ryan Carhart, 23, is walking into the voting booth with a big decision still unmade.
        </p><p>
        When she voted in 2008, Carhart chose to cast her ballot in favor of Barack Obama. This time, she won’t know whether she’s voting the same way until she fills in that bubble.
        </p><p>
        “I haven’t made up my mind,” she said. “I’m the worst decision maker of all time.”
        </p><p>
        Standing in line next to Carhart is Sam Franklin, 23, a first-year physical therapy graduate student with whom Carhart has been friends since the beginning of their college experience.
        </p><p>
        When asked what will end up helping her make her decision, Carhart lets Franklin answer.
        </p><p>
        “Me, convicing her to vote Obama this whole time in line,” he said.
        </p><p>
        Carhart showed up and found Franklin in line.
        </p><p>
        “It was good timing,” Franklin said.
        </p><p>
        Carhart agreed that it was a nice coincidence.
        </p><p>

        <h3>Obama rallies capacity crowd of supporters Thursday at BankUnited Center</h3>
        <strong>Oct. 11, 2012</strong>
        <p>
        President Barack Obama fired up supporters at his grassroots event at the BankUnited Center Thursday afternoon with a speech that touched on his accomplishments over the past four years and his mission to move the country forward during the next four.
        </p><p>
        “Four more years,” was a favorite chant of the capacity crowd, which expressed its enthusiasm with cheers, applause and even one shout of “I love you, Barack.”
        </p><p>
        Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz – who is also the chair of the Democratic National Committee – gave opening remarks, as did Sen. Bill Nelson and an Obama For America organizer. UM freshman Elizabeth Cooke, who has worked on the campaign this year with Canes for Obama, introduced the president and offered her take on why students should support him.
        </p><p>
        “We know that he’s out there fighting for every single one of us every single day,” Cooke told the audience. “It’s our turn now to go out and fight for him.”
        </p><p>
        Obama started by highlighting his accomplishments, which include ending the war in Iraq, passing health care reform, and repealing “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.” He also spoke directly to the student crowd by addressing issues related to education.
        </p><p>
        “I refuse to pay for that tax cut by asking students at the U to pay more for college,” Obama said in his speech, referring to former Gov. Mitt Romney’s proposed tax plan. <a href="http://www.themiamihurricane.com/2012/10/11/obama-rallies-capacity-crowd-of-supporters-thursday-at-bankunited-center/">Read more.</a>

        <h3>History reveals iconic ‘U’ logo’s meaning</h3>
        <strong>April 26, 2012</strong>
        <p>
        There are thousands of universities across the nation but only one gets to be The U. From the creation of the split-U logo to the forthcoming installation of the U statue on campus, the U identity has influenced culture at the University of Miami in a variety of ways. Here’s a look at how U logos and traditions have evolved.
        </p><p>
        <strong>1973 – Split-U logo is born</strong>
        <br/>
        Miami athletics had gone through several years of uniform and helmet changes, with inconsistent logos ranging from an M to UM. The Athletic Federation—now the Hurricane Club, the student-athlete scholarship fund—commissioned a logo re-design that brought about the split-U logo in 1973.
        </p><p>
        The athletic department was looking for something that would symbolize the University of Miami without having to say those words, according to Evelyn Schwartz, a former assistant athletic director with the Athletic Federation. The letters UM were not enough because they could have represented many other schools.
        </p><p>
        Miami-bred publicist Julian Cole, who was the first graduate of UM’s radio and television department, worked with graphic artist Bill Bodenhamer to develop the green and orange split-U logo.
        </p><p>
        In the middle of the U, different images for each sport were inserted, like a baseball player, football player or tennis player. The U was then used for slogans like “U gotta believe,” “U is great,” and “U is moving forward.”
        </p><p>
        Both Cole and Bodenhamer have since passed away but their legacy lives on. They designed not only the U but also the Miami Dolphins logo.
        </p><p>
        “If you think about it, it was quite a stretch,” said Lisa Cole, one of Julian’s daughters. “They took the U and said, ‘This is the university.’” <a href="http://www.themiamihurricane.com/2012/04/26/history-reveals-iconic-%E2%80%98u%E2%80%99-logo%E2%80%99s-meaning-2/">Read more.</a>
