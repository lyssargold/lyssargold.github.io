        <strong>THOMAS SCHOOS DESIGNS ELLIPSIS…</strong> 
        </p>
        <p class="centered">
        <em>Mumbai’s Modern American Culinary Concept Heightens Dining Experience with Contemporary and Romantic Elements</em>
        </p><p>
        <strong>MUMBAI, INDIA – (JULY 2012) –</strong> Ellipsis, the new Modern American culinary concept restaurant owned and operated by Rohan Talwar and Ranbir Batra of  IB Hospitality, combines history and modernism for a unique dining experience. Designed by the award-winning artist and designer Thomas Schoos, the two-floor restaurant housed within a 4400 square-foot space was unveiled in Mumbai’s upscale Colaba neighborhood this month.
        </p><p>
        Set in a 19th century building in Mumbai, Ellipsis Restaurant combines contemporary style with the opulence and romance of the past for a stimulating interplay of history and modernism. Designer Thomas Schoos has crafted a casual yet elegant environment for modern dining, which pays homage to history by evoking the building’s pedigree in a novel way.  Instead of attempting a lavish recreation of a former era, Schoos began the redesign by stripping away all surface elements from the building’s structure. This revealed the building’s authentic colonial‐era architecture. 
        </p><p>
        With newly clean and whitewashed walls, the building’s shell served as a neutral canvas for an intriguing variety of furnishings and art – both modern and antique. The restaurant’s furniture and fixtures are subtle, modern pieces that have been custom‐designed for the space by Schoos.  All upholstery is restrained to quiet tones of grey, with complementary hardwood flooring. A streamlined floating staircase made of dark wood, framed in geometric elements, divides the restaurant into two levels. The sleek glass railing with barely visible exposed metalwork, adds to the illusion of a diagonally hovering flight of steps.
        </p><p>
        To contrast this modernist environment, Schoos has installed an explosion of vintage paintings from every period over the last century. These vibrant canvases cover the walls from floor to ceiling in a patchwork pattern, interrupted at irregular intervals by vintage wall sconces.  The tabletop tilework in red, green and brown earth tones features a textile design simultaneously evocative of medieval times and artistic luxury.
        </p><p>
        The combined effect brings to mind an artist’s studio from 19th-century London or Paris, with a creative exuberance that remains unhindered by modern simplicity.  By arranging this visual extravaganza in a modern context, Schoos allows diners at the restaurant to consider history in a new light – from a modern perspective. To round out the stylistic variety, several examples of modern art and design are mixed into the antique artistic selection. Ellipsis… features two original paintings by Schoos himself as well as several large dramatic lighting fixtures designed by Schoos, made up of dominant clusters of light bulbs in various sizes. 
        </p><p>
        Ellipsis’…  Private Dining Room appears to throw guests into another location entirely, quaint, but upscale with both a cozy dining table that seats up to ten and an individual sofa chair.  Tall-standing lamps and edgy sconces shed a warm light on the beige walls, which are covered in paintings from every style and period. The matching cloth drapery blends with the walls and adds an element of privacy against faux windows, allowing for an unparalleled exclusive mealtime event.
        </p><p>
        The eclectic combination of styles, periods and textures is both stimulating and tasteful, like dining in the home of an avid art collector with a wide range of interests.  It makes for a unique and personal dining experience, where the visual presentation is as varied and distinctive as the sumptuous food created by Executive Chef, Kelvin Cheung.
        </p><p>
        <strong>ABOUT THOMAS SCHOOS </strong><br/>
        Artist, designer, developer and entrepreneur, Thomas Schoos has brought his unique brand of creative expression to a wide range of design projects – from distinctive private residences to award-winning hotels and restaurants.

        <p class="centered"><strong>TRUMBULL MARRIOTT MERRITT PARKWAY FINALIZES TWO-YEAR RENOVATION</strong></p>
        <p class="centered"><em>Rubin Design Group Led Project to Refurbish 325 Guest Rooms, Update All Common Spaces and Introduce New Restaurant</em></p>
        <p>
        <strong>Trumbull, Conn. – (November 2012) – </strong>Trumbull Marriott Merritt Parkway (“Trumbull Marriott”) announces today the public reveal of the hotel’s two-year renovation, which included a redesign to all 325 guest rooms, common spaces and the on-site restaurant. Spearheading the projects were Marcia Rubin, president and head designer of Rubin Design Group, who designed all of the public spaces and guestrooms, and Jeff Mick of Mick White Renovations, LLC, who oversaw the construction of the lobby, library, restaurant and more.
        </p><p>
        Situated in a region of the country with rich history and diverse landscapes – from woodlands to farmlands and waterways – the Trumbull Marriott reflects a contemporary embodiment of the welcoming New England style. Crisp clean lines along with architectural features that underscore warmth and beauty were key elements in the renovation.
        </p><p>
        The focal point of the public space redesign is the two-story, double-sided, natural fieldstone fireplace with a limestone ledge. The central structure unites the lobby and brings a sense of community and energy to the space. The hearth is surrounded by furniture in a range of earth tones including deep brown leather seating and accenting beige coffee tables. 
        </p><p>
        The use of natural materials helps the space to complement the region’s inherent charm. While the lobby’s blue stone flooring is indigenous to the area, Palomino Exotic stone in a caramel color covers the front desk and has been imported from Brazil. 
        </p><p>
        “My approach to the Trumbull Marriott renovation was to cater to the surrounding community that often have family visiting here.  By using materials indigenous to the area we hoped to create a fresh New England look," said Rubin. "Conversely, the Trumbull Marriott also commonly sees international travelers and as such, we felt it important to incorporate some of these unique design accents,” Rubin said.
        </p><p>
        Additional nods to local historicism are showcased through photographic artwork that adorns the walls. Local photographers were commissioned to capture New England’s earthy scenes of landscapes in Connecticut’s state parks, beaches, farms as well as historic sites like town hall buildings, a fort and a memorial bridge.
        </p><p>
        Ornamental light fixtures - like décor by Hammerton Lighting in medium bronze finishes and Lusive Lighting in hand-blown glass globe pendants - hang over the communal tables in the library and lounge.  Other notable design finishes include custom, geometric-patterned, frosted glass partitions and sliding glass doors from GMD Industries, which are featured in the hotel’s connector corridor as well as the bar, lounge, restaurant and private dining room spaces. 
        </p><p>
        Event spaces have also been renovated to provide the ideal meeting space for any conference, reception, banquet or small gathering. With new woodwork, The Grand Ballroom offers more than 6,500-square-feet of space and the Merritt Rooms, which have a combined capacity of 900, now include an expanded opening with glass doors.
        </p><p>
        The suites have an updated room configuration, including new furniture layouts, updated electrical and sound systems as well as upgraded bathrooms. Additional room amenities include international charging stations, iHome alarm clock and media players, flat-screen plasma televisions with connections to convert from television to computer display or side-by-side viewing and mini bar. 
        </p><p>
        In addition to these renovations, a new modern American fine dining restaurant, under the direction of James Beard-nominated chef Dean James Max, has been added to the hotel’s repertoire. Offering a bold and flavorful menu with Northeastern regional flair, Parallel Post is an intimate, yet casual eatery that uses seasonal, local ingredients prepared with contemporary, healthy techniques. Along with its new menu comes a new look; Parallel Post replaces the former J. Porter’s restaurant and brings the Trumbull Marriott’s redesign full circle. 
        </p><p>
