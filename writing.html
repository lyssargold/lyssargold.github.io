        <h3>Taking love from the classroom to the chapel</h3>
        <strong>By Lyssa Goldberg</strong>
        <br/><br/>
        Students enter UM planning to leave with a college degree, but a lucky few also leave with a life-long partner. On campus, the Love Bridge leading to the Wellness Center is decorated with bricks commemorating the love of couples who met and fell in love at UM. Now, tales of romance can also be found on the “Stories of U” website, launched by the Alumni Association as a way for alumni to share their experiences as a Cane.

        <strong>Struck by an arrow</strong>
        <br/>
        Thirteen years ago, Erin Moyer and Manny Carballea met at the Starbucks across U.S. 1 to talk about the Iron Arrow Honor Society.
        <br/><br/>
        When their informal meeting turned into a four-hour conversation about everything but academics, the two knew they had hit it off.
        <br/><br/>
        Reflecting back on the moment, Moyer said that, without intending for it to be, this essentially ended up being their first date.
        <br/><br/>
        “Honestly, from that point forward, we kind of made excuses to see each other, like, ‘Oh yeah, we should probably talk Iron Arrow’ or ‘Oh yeah, I go to Starbucks all the time to study. Sure, I’ll see you there,’” she said. “I never went to Starbucks to study, but it gave me a good reason to do so.”

      <h3>Mindfulness Miami minds mental health</h3>
      <strong>By Lyssa Goldberg</strong>
      <br/><br/>
      Junior Jose Miguel Rosillo sits in a relaxed yet alert position on the second floor of the Student Activities Center. His window seat has a view of Lake Osceola, and the sun is setting. But his eyes are closed.
      <br/><br/>
      He inhales. Then exhales. For one minute, he focuses on his breath. This short exercise aimed at clearing up his mind is an example of mindfulness  training (MT) in its simplest form.
      <br/><br/>
      Mindfulness consists of a purposeful, non-judgmental awareness of the present moment.
      <br/><br/>
      “What you’re doing with mindfulness is training two faculties: attention and meta-attention,” Rosillo said. “There’s both instant gratification and long-term gratification.”
      <br/><br/>
      As Rosillo describes it, mindfulness helps you recognize the many layers of your current reality, and it increases the resolution and vividness with which you perceive things.
      <br/><br/>
      “Some people think you just sit around, that it’s passive,” he said. “That’s a misconception.”
      <br/><br/>
      In his quest to bring the message of mindfulness to the school, Rosillo has done much more than sitting around. There’s been some lying around, too.
      <br/><br/>
      Rosillo introduced junior Augustine Kazickas to the principles of mindfulness by recommending that his friend read “Search Inside Yourself” by Chade-Meng Tan, the book that started it all for Rosillo.
      <br/><br/>
      Kazickas read it over the summer, and they returned  to campus in the fall feeling the need to share mindfulness with the University of Miami community. One day in September, they were lying in the grass near the Knight Physics building, talking the idea over.

      <h3>Drugstore shuts down local strip-mall</h3>
      <strong>By Lyssa Goldberg</strong>
      <br/><br/>
      On an inconspicuous corner of a strip-mall about a mile from the University of Miami’s Coral Gables campus, Beehive Natural Foods sells supplements and snacks. At lunchtime, the Beehive Juice Bar in the back bustles with hungry regulars at its counter.
      <br/><br/>
      “Carlitos, I’m starving,” murmurs a woman whose young daughter is attached to her hip.
      <br/><br/>
      “Right away,” the chef answers devotedly.
      <br/><br/>
      The customers are craving  vegetarian and vegan fare like bean sprout burgers. Still, more than that, they crave Beehive’s sense of community.
      <br/><br/>
      Beehive has been an institution for decades. The storefront’s current owner, Bob Penna, has been with Beehive for 33 years. Carlos Schicchi has been running the juice bar for 23 years.
      <br/><br/>
      “People go to the Beehive largely because of my dad’s personality,” said Gabriel Schicchi, son of the Brazilian chef. “He’s there waiting for you, serves the food that he made himself, talks to you, makes a ton of bad jokes, but makes you want to come back.”
      <br/><br/>
      Both Penna and Schicchi are the reason that loyal patrons from the South Miami area, including many from UM, return to the health food establishment again and again.
      <br/><br/>
      But a man-made disturbance may disrupt this natural order at Beehive.
      <br/><br/>
      CVS Pharmacy has bought out the strip-mall on the 5700 block of Bird Road. Beehive Natural Foods and Juice Bar will be kicked out this coming January.
