        <h3>Sophomore casts line on campus fishing</h3>
        <strong>April 9, 2014</strong>
        <br/><br/>
        Sophomore Derek Sheldon, who was raised in Plano, Texas, where bass fishing is popular, has been hooked on fishing ever since he was a child.
        <br/><br/>
        “It’s just a large part of the culture in Texas,” he said. “I can’t even remember the first time I went fishing, but that probably is because I was so young.”
        <br/><br/>
        Now at the University of Miami, Sheldon casts his fishing reel into Lake Osceola as a way to relieve stress once or twice a week.
        <br/><br/>
        <strong>Sustainability and safety</strong>
        <br/>
        The time of day, tides and position of where he’s fishing in the lake all play a role in how many fish Sheldon catches. Out of habit, Sheldon typically fishes early in the mornings or in the evenings.
        <br/><br/>
        “That’s when people say the fish bite,” he said. “Lake Osceola has four tides a day, just like the ocean does. I haven’t quite learned how to fish with the tides here, but it’s definitely a game of timing.”
        <br/><br/>
        There was a span of two weeks where he’d catch up to six fish a day, Sheldon said. On the other hand, when the net that keeps the manatees out of the campus waterways is secured properly, there are fewer fish, he said. <a href="http://www.themiamihurricane.com/2014/04/09/sophomore-casts-line-on-campus-fishing/">Read more.</a>

      <h3>Mindfulness Miami minds mental health</h3>
      <strong>January 27, 2014</strong>
      <br/><br/>
      Junior Jose Miguel Rosillo sits in a relaxed yet alert position on the second floor of the Student Activities Center. His window seat has a view of Lake Osceola, and the sun is setting. But his eyes are closed.
      <br/><br/>
      He inhales. Then exhales. For one minute, he focuses on his breath. This short exercise aimed at clearing up his mind is an example of mindfulness  training (MT) in its simplest form.
      <br/><br/>
      Mindfulness consists of a purposeful, non-judgmental awareness of the present moment.
      <br/><br/>
      “What you’re doing with mindfulness is training two faculties: attention and meta-attention,” Rosillo said. “There’s both instant gratification and long-term gratification.”
      <br/><br/>
      As Rosillo describes it, mindfulness helps you recognize the many layers of your current reality, and it increases the resolution and vividness with which you perceive things.
      <br/><br/>
      “Some people think you just sit around, that it’s passive,” he said. “That’s a misconception.”
      <br/><br/>
      In his quest to bring the message of mindfulness to the school, Rosillo has done much more than sitting around. There’s been some lying around, too.
      <br/><br/>
      Rosillo introduced junior Augustine Kazickas to the principles of mindfulness by recommending that his friend read “Search Inside Yourself” by Chade-Meng Tan, the book that started it all for Rosillo.
      <br/><br/>
      Kazickas read it over the summer, and they returned  to campus in the fall feeling the need to share mindfulness with the University of Miami community. One day in September, they were lying in the grass near the Knight Physics building, talking the idea over. <a href="http://www.themiamihurricane.com/2014/01/27/mindfulness-miami-minds-mental-health/">Read more.</a>

      <h3>Drugstore shuts down local strip-mall</h3>
      <strong>Sept. 23, 2013</strong>
      <br/><br/>
      On an inconspicuous corner of a strip-mall about a mile from the University of Miami’s Coral Gables campus, Beehive Natural Foods sells supplements and snacks. At lunchtime, the Beehive Juice Bar in the back bustles with hungry regulars at its counter.
      <br/><br/>
      “Carlitos, I’m starving,” murmurs a woman whose young daughter is attached to her hip.
      <br/><br/>
      “Right away,” the chef answers devotedly.
      <br/><br/>
      The customers are craving  vegetarian and vegan fare like bean sprout burgers. Still, more than that, they crave Beehive’s sense of community.
      <br/><br/>
      Beehive has been an institution for decades. The storefront’s current owner, Bob Penna, has been with Beehive for 33 years. Carlos Schicchi has been running the juice bar for 23 years.
      <br/><br/>
      “People go to the Beehive largely because of my dad’s personality,” said Gabriel Schicchi, son of the Brazilian chef. “He’s there waiting for you, serves the food that he made himself, talks to you, makes a ton of bad jokes, but makes you want to come back.”
      <br/><br/>
      Both Penna and Schicchi are the reason that loyal patrons from the South Miami area, including many from UM, return to the health food establishment again and again.
      <br/><br/>
      But a man-made disturbance may disrupt this natural order at Beehive.
      <br/><br/>
      CVS Pharmacy has bought out the strip-mall on the 5700 block of Bird Road. Beehive Natural Foods and Juice Bar will be kicked out this coming January. <a href="http://www.themiamihurricane.com/2013/09/23/drugstore-shuts-down-local-strip-mall/">Read more.</a>

        <h3>Mat Kearney takes Lauderdale Live audience on successful first date</h3>
        <strong>Dec. 9, 2013</strong>
        <br/><br/>
        Holding a music festival during South Florida’s busiest cultural weekend doesn’t sound like the brightest idea. But for those who attended Lauderdale Live instead of Art Basel from Friday through Sunday, it was a rare opportunity to have an intimate experience with the musicians (by default of having such a small crowd in attendance).
        <br/><br/>
        Mat Kearney, the “Ships in the Night” singer who got his start in 2006 with the album “Nothing Left to Lose,” performed in Downtown Fort Lauderdale’s Huizenga Plaza Saturday night, and took advantage of this atmosphere.
        <br/><br/>
        During his set, Kearney adopted an anything-goes approach, which made for a memorable experience.
        <br/><br/>
        “Tonight was unique,” he told The Miami Hurricane.
        <br/><br/>
        Kearney broke typical concert rules when he asked the crowd to shout out their requests and performed a song that his band didn’t even know how to back: “City of Black &amp; White,” the title track off his third album that he rarely plays for an audience.
        <br/><br/>
        “With a music festival like this, it’s not like a small venue where everyone comes for you. It’s kind of like a first date,” Kearney said. “The challenge is to win them over. You’re hoping to at least get a kiss at the end of the night.” <a href="http://www.themiamihurricane.com/2013/12/09/mat-kearney-takes-lauderdale-live-audience-on-successful-first-date/">Read more.</a>

        <h3>Hecht, Stanford stereotypes shape freshman perspective</h3>
        <strong>April 21, 2013</strong>
        <br/><br/>
        As future members of the Class of 2017 rejoice in their acceptances and interact on Facebook, the rumors about the Hecht and Stanford Residential Colleges are already swirling.
        <br/><br/>
        “Hecht or Stanford guys?” one high school senior posts, and dozens of comments start to roll in.
        <br/><br/>
        “From what I’ve heard, Hecht dorms are more welcoming to the party atmosphere, if that interests you,” one comments.
        <br/><br/>
        “My friend is currently in Stanford and says they’re about equal in partying even though Hecht has more of a rep!” another responds.
        <br/><br/>
        These comments were taken from a closed group on Facebook for admitted students to the Class of 2017.
        <br/><br/>
        In an online survey conducted by The Miami Hurricane, only 21 percent of students had no opinion about either dorm before arriving at UM. Three quarters believed that Hecht is the party dorm, and more than half thought that Stanford is the studious dorm.
        <br/><br/>
        “There’s certainly nothing that we do from a housing perspective to indicate that there’s a difference between the buildings or that there’s a different vibe or feel,” said Christopher Hartnett, associate director for residence life. “I think some of it honestly is some urban myth and urban legend that students have passed down form one year to another.” <a href="http://www.themiamihurricane.com/2013/04/21/hecht-stanford-stereotypes-shape-freshman-perspective/">Read more.</a>

        <h3>Taking love from the classroom to the chapel</h3>
        <strong>Feb. 13, 2013</strong>
        <br/><br/>
        Students enter UM planning to leave with a college degree, but a lucky few also leave with a life-long partner. On campus, the Love Bridge leading to the Wellness Center is decorated with bricks commemorating the love of couples who met and fell in love at UM. Now, tales of romance can also be found on the “Stories of U” website, launched by the Alumni Association as a way for alumni to share their experiences as a Cane.
        <br/><br/>
        <strong>Struck by an arrow</strong>
        <br/>
        Thirteen years ago, Erin Moyer and Manny Carballea met at the Starbucks across U.S. 1 to talk about the Iron Arrow Honor Society.
        <br/><br/>
        When their informal meeting turned into a four-hour conversation about everything but academics, the two knew they had hit it off.
        <br/><br/>
        Reflecting back on the moment, Moyer said that, without intending for it to be, this essentially ended up being their first date.
        <br/><br/>
        “Honestly, from that point forward, we kind of made excuses to see each other, like, ‘Oh yeah, we should probably talk Iron Arrow’ or ‘Oh yeah, I go to Starbucks all the time to study. Sure, I’ll see you there,’” she said. “I never went to Starbucks to study, but it gave me a good reason to do so.” <a href="http://www.themiamihurricane.com/2013/02/13/finding-love-at-the-u/">Read more.</a>

        <h3>Dining halls implement green option</h3>
        <strong>Feb. 7, 2013</strong>
        <br/><br/>
        Freshmen leaving Hecht-Stanford Dining Hall with disposable to-go containers enjoy eating their meals outdoors, making conversation with friends outside of Stanford Residential College, and looking out at the intramural fields. These students finish eating and stack their boxes artfully, like professional Jenga players.
        <br/><br/>
        But the boxes piled atop the trash bins eventually form a replica of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. When a dozen to-go containers become a dozen plus one, the spillover transforms into litter all over the ground.
        <br/><br/>
        Trash bins overflowing with disposable take-out boxes, which are compostable, can be seen outside of the Mahoney-Pearson and Hecht-Stanford dining halls on a daily basis. When compostable items became litter, freshman Athena Jones knew there was a problem.
        <br/><br/>
        Jones, the education outreach co-chair for the Energy &amp; Conservation Organization (ECO) Agency, is now working with the members of Student Government’s green programming board to rectify this waste issue by promoting use of reusable rather than disposable boxes.
        <br/><br/>
        “They’re biodegradable if you do compost properly, but otherwise they’re going to a traditional landfill when they’re placed in these garbage cans …” Jones said. “They actually have the same life in the landfill that a Styrofoam box would have, and they produce more carbon dioxide to make. It’s a much more intensive process to make these boxes and therefore they have more of a carbon footprint on the environment than Styrofoam.” <a href="http://www.themiamihurricane.com/2013/02/07/dining-halls-implement-green-option/">Read more.</a>

        <h3>Election Day at UM brings surprises, student enthusiasm</h3>
        <strong>Nov. 6, 2012</strong>
        <br/><br/>
        Students at UM hit the polls on campus as early as 7 a.m., as soon as they opened.
        <br/><br/>
        Both presidential candidates, including President Barack Obama and Republican candidate Mitt Romney, have been looking to garner support from the state of Florida, which has a total of 29 electoral votes and has been considered a powerful swing state during this election.
        <br/><br/>
        ...
        <br/><br/>
        <strong>Undecided at the poll</strong>
        <br/>
        Fifth-year senior Ryan Carhart, 23, is walking into the voting booth with a big decision still unmade.
        <br/><br/>
        When she voted in 2008, Carhart chose to cast her ballot in favor of Barack Obama. This time, she won’t know whether she’s voting the same way until she fills in that bubble.
        <br/><br/>
        “I haven’t made up my mind,” she said. “I’m the worst decision maker of all time.”
        <br/><br/>
        Standing in line next to Carhart is Sam Franklin, 23, a first-year physical therapy graduate student with whom Carhart has been friends since the beginning of their college experience.
        <br/><br/>
        When asked what will end up helping her make her decision, Carhart lets Franklin answer.
        <br/><br/>
        “Me, convicing her to vote Obama this whole time in line,” he said.
        <br/><br/>
        Carhart showed up and found Franklin in line.
        <br/><br/>
        “It was good timing,” Franklin said.
        <br/><br/>
        Carhart agreed that it was a nice coincidence.
        <br/><br/>
        “I have a voting buddy,” she said. <a href="http://www.themiamihurricane.com/2012/11/06/election-day-at-um-brings-surprises-student-enthusiasm/">Read more.</a>

        <h3>Obama rallies capacity crowd of supporters Thursday at BankUnited Center</h3>
        <strong>Oct. 11, 2012</strong>
        <br/><br/>
        President Barack Obama fired up supporters at his grassroots event at the BankUnited Center Thursday afternoon with a speech that touched on his accomplishments over the past four years and his mission to move the country forward during the next four.
        <br/><br/>
        “Four more years,” was a favorite chant of the capacity crowd, which expressed its enthusiasm with cheers, applause and even one shout of “I love you, Barack.”
        <br/><br/>
        Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz – who is also the chair of the Democratic National Committee – gave opening remarks, as did Sen. Bill Nelson and an Obama For America organizer. UM freshman Elizabeth Cooke, who has worked on the campaign this year with Canes for Obama, introduced the president and offered her take on why students should support him.
        <br/><br/>
        “We know that he’s out there fighting for every single one of us every single day,” Cooke told the audience. “It’s our turn now to go out and fight for him.”
        <br/><br/>
        Obama started by highlighting his accomplishments, which include ending the war in Iraq, passing health care reform, and repealing “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.” He also spoke directly to the student crowd by addressing issues related to education.
        <br/><br/>
        “I refuse to pay for that tax cut by asking students at the U to pay more for college,” Obama said in his speech, referring to former Gov. Mitt Romney’s proposed tax plan. <a href="http://www.themiamihurricane.com/2012/10/11/obama-rallies-capacity-crowd-of-supporters-thursday-at-bankunited-center/">Read more.</a>

        <h3>History reveals iconic ‘U’ logo’s meaning</h3>
        <strong>April 26, 2012</strong>
        <br/><br/>
        There are thousands of universities across the nation but only one gets to be The U. From the creation of the split-U logo to the forthcoming installation of the U statue on campus, the U identity has influenced culture at the University of Miami in a variety of ways. Here’s a look at how U logos and traditions have evolved.
        <br/><br/>
        <strong>1973 – Split-U logo is born</strong>
        <br/>
        Miami athletics had gone through several years of uniform and helmet changes, with inconsistent logos ranging from an M to UM. The Athletic Federation—now the Hurricane Club, the student-athlete scholarship fund—commissioned a logo re-design that brought about the split-U logo in 1973.
        <br/><br/>
        The athletic department was looking for something that would symbolize the University of Miami without having to say those words, according to Evelyn Schwartz, a former assistant athletic director with the Athletic Federation. The letters UM were not enough because they could have represented many other schools.
        <br/><br/>
        Miami-bred publicist Julian Cole, who was the first graduate of UM’s radio and television department, worked with graphic artist Bill Bodenhamer to develop the green and orange split-U logo.
        <br/><br/>
        In the middle of the U, different images for each sport were inserted, like a baseball player, football player or tennis player. The U was then used for slogans like “U gotta believe,” “U is great,” and “U is moving forward.”
        <br/><br/>
        Both Cole and Bodenhamer have since passed away but their legacy lives on. They designed not only the U but also the Miami Dolphins logo.
        <br/><br/>
        “If you think about it, it was quite a stretch,” said Lisa Cole, one of Julian’s daughters. “They took the U and said, ‘This is the university.’” <a href="http://www.themiamihurricane.com/2012/04/26/history-reveals-iconic-%E2%80%98u%E2%80%99-logo%E2%80%99s-meaning-2/">Read more.</a>
