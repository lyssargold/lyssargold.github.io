          Marlins Park opened in 2012 in Little Havana at the site of the former Orange Bowl, a neighborhood in which the median income is around $21,000 per household. That puts these families in the bottom 10 percent in the nation. Local government officials said the ballpark would revitalize the community, but with two baseball seasons behind us and the third now well underway, it has become evident that this promise has not held true.
          <br/><br/>
          Because there is not enough parking available in the garages at the stadium, many individuals – as well as local businesses – have opened up their homes and lots for additional parking space. These low-income families stand out there every game day for the opportunity to make $10-15 per car that parks on their property. Still, home and apartment owners who have lived in the neighborhood for decades say they miss the heyday of the Orange Bowl, when they wouldn’t even have enough room to accommodate all the parking demand.
          <br/><br/>
          I wanted to take a look past the stadium and the parking situation and tell a story about the other people I’d find. More than 90 percent of people living in the neighborhood are Hispanic or Latino – half are Cuban. I often visited before first pitch, but I returned sometimes at the end of the night and even on empty weekend afternoons while the baseball team was away. Upon first glance, the surroundings of Marlins Park are not bustling with life when there are no fans pouring into the stadium. But if you pay close attention to the street vendors, the families sitting and chatting out in their front yard, and the father and son pair tossing a baseball, you’ll find a community with a heart.
